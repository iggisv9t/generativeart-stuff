`datafest.ipynb` -- tutorial notebook with an introduction how to 
1. work with a picture as numpy array
2. apply arbitrary math functions to the image
3. play with increasing and decreasing dimensionality of the image array

Check out [this repo](https://github.com/iggisv9t/dimreducers-crusher) to learn more about dimension reduction tools.

# How to run it
You need [python](https://www.python.org/), [pip](https://pypi.org/), [jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) and everything listed in `requirements.txt`  
Installation instructions depends on what OS you use. Just google it. When first three are installed, type `pip install -r requirements.txt` in order to install packages.  

I recommend to check [this](http://jalammar.github.io/visual-numpy/) out to get an idea how to work with multidemensional numpy arrays.

Also you can avoid `opencv-python` because I use it just to read images to numpy arrays.
